## Key Insights

    High-Severity States: States like VA, PA, NC, NY, and FL report the highest number of Severity Level 4 accidents.
    Rush Hour Risks: Most accidents occur during rush hours, highlighting traffic congestion as a major factor.
    Weather Impacts: Rain and snow significantly increase accident risks.
